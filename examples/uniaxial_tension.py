# We can set up the experiment by defining a stretch $\lambda$ along a given axis, say along the $x$-axis. The corresponding stretch along the $y$- and $z$-axis will then be $\lambda^{-1/2}$

experiment = zero_mech.experiments.uniaxial_tension(axis=0)
display(experiment.F)

# To create an experiment with the stretch acting along a different axis you just change the `axis` argument, e.g

display(zero_mech.experiments.uniaxial_tension(axis=1).F)

# Now we need to specify the material model, here we use a NeoHookean model (but we have also commented out the code for using a Holzapfel-Ogden model

# Here one could also use a different material model such as the Holzapfel Ogden model

# If you want to look at how the strain energy function looks like you can do as follows

mat.strain_energy(experiment.F)

# Now this strain energy function is specific to the uniaxial experiment. To get the full general strain energy function, you can instead create a full experiment

full = zero_mech.experiments.full_matrix()
display(full)

# and pass that the deformation gradient from this experiement in

mat.strain_energy(full.F)

# And to get the general formula you can call the `str` method

# If you choose an incompressible model, then we need to also solve for the hydrostatic pressure `p` which is introduced as a Lagrange multiplier. In this case `p` would be a variable in the model and we can solve for the stress being zero in one of the axis orthogonal to the axis in which we extend / compress the material
